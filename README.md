# Stanford-Encyclopedia-of-Philosophy-chatbot
SEP chatbot utilizing their entire encyclopedia as RAG

## Live Demo
By the request of Stanford I was politely asked to remove the demo. I was also asked to make explict the fact that this project is NOT affliated with Stanford in any way.  
Worry not Stanford has been more than supportive and allowed me to keep this repository active.  
I will publish a guide on how it can be built on your local machine.  
Please do not deploy it on Streamlit or any other service with a visible URL, as Stanford has been explicit in their request.  
**This is for personal use only.**
